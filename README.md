Interactive Twine game using SugarCube to incorporate HTML/CSS and JavaScript to modify the game's visual and audio elements. 

The work intends to replicate to some extent the experience of immigration and encountering a new culture and language through the use of puzzles and microaggressions as the player attempts to navigate their way through a fictional new planet. 

It's immigration. In space.
